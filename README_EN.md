SmartChat is an Agent and RAG application developed based on the Langchain framework. It leverages large language models to understand the semantics of conversation content and automatically invokes relevant tools to perform various tasks according to the context of the conversation. These tasks include querying Taiwan weather, web-based Q&A, image-based Q&A, image generation, file processing, search engine Q&A, finding Arxiv papers, and Wikipedia queries. Through the automated integration of these tools, SmartChat provides accurate responses, meeting users' diverse needs from information retrieval to content generation, thereby intelligently and efficiently solving a wide range of problems.
